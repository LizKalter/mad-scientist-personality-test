    title: 'The Megalomaniacal Genius',
    description: 'While all mad scientists are megalomaniacal geniuses to some extent, your type epitomizes it. To you the universe is just a giant test tube. The suffering you cause during your experiments is insignifigant compared to the value of the data that is collected. You prefer to work with computers and even devise ways of interfacing with them in order to expand your intellectual capacity. You aspire to a level of understanding that will enable you to manipulate the fundamental nature of the universe. You are seen by most people as a calculating, soulless force that must be stopped, but their intelligence is far inferior to yours, therefore their opinions are of no consequence.',

    title: 'The Sadistic Destroyer of Psyches',
    description: 'Your type strikes fear deepest into the hearts of others because you like to take the time to seduce and manipulate your victims before you start cutting into them. No doubt you have perfected your own individual style of evil laugh, often heard pealing across the mangled landscape by the few sane people you\'ve left alive. You work in the organic sciences and have created at least one unique species of miserable, mutant creature that you abuse. You are especially enthralled by the workings of the mind. For example, you probably have a collection of telepathically linked brains that you keep in jars and force to sing lullabies to you during your nap time. When you\'ve been crossed, your thirst for revenge is unquenchable. If nobody\'s crossed you lately, you remember all of the times you were crossed in the past and go find one of those people. Life just doesn\'t feel complete without somebody to torture in all concievable ways.',
    warning: 'Note: It is difficult to find a genuine example of this type of mad scientist because the other types often temporarily descend to this level after an unsuccessful venture. Therefore, it is possible that your behavior is merely compensation for unresolved psychological issues. A visit to the shrink would be recommended if that weren\'t already one of your areas of expertise. If you believe this is your true type, continue.',

    title: 'The Domineering Fist of God',
    description: 'Many groveling thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule for this test. Because your ideas are the best in the universe, it only makes sense that everyone should submit to you in implementing them. You have genetically engineered a vast and varied army of minions for every conceivable purpose. You deter betrayal with the swift elimination of anyone who doesn\'t adhere precisely to your infallible plans. You like to project your face across the sky of defensless planets as you inform the inhabitants that every machine and piece of technology they own has been taken over by your mother ship. You are indeed the greatest in a long tradition of mad scientists. Watch your back.',

    title: 'The Anarchic Disrupter of the Space-Time Continuum',
    description: 'Of all the mad scientist types, yours has the most toys. You like to wear psychophonic headgear and a strength enhancing exoskeleton just for fun. You invent stuff like time machines and wormhole generators to further your unending quest of exploration and discovery. Nobody realizes that the universe used to be a really nice place before you started messing with it. Most people just think you\'re a wacko with singed hair, but you know better. You\'ve been places and seen things... if only your inventions didn\'t blow up immediately after you use them.',
